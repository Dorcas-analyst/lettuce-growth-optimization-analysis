### Project Overview

This project analyzes 3,169 lettuce growth records from Vertical Acres Farm (2023) to uncover how temperature, humidity, TDS, and pH levels influence lettuce development.
Conducted entirely in Microsoft Excel, the study transforms raw agricultural data into actionable insights for indoor farming optimization.
 - Tools Used: Excel, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Data Cleaning, Trend Analysis
 - Data Source: Kaggle — Lettuce Growth Days Dataset (August–September 2023)

### Key Discoveries

 - **Friday & Saturday:** Highest growth performance (pH ≈ 6.41, temperature ≈ 28.7°C).
 - **Midweek dips:** Reduced nutrient adequacy and environmental stability.
 - **Vegetative Stage:** Largest plant count but weakest nutrient adequacy (58%).
 - **Optimal conditions:** Temperature (24–27°C), Humidity (60–70%), pH (6.2–6.5).
